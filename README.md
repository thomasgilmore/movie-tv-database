<h1>Entertainment Database</h1>

<p>This Entertaimnent Database searches The MovieDB API and returns a list of movies that mach your search.</p>

<p>I used React to create the frontend for this project. I used two AJAX calls for the two different API endpoints to return the data to the user and using Netlify to host the app.</p>
